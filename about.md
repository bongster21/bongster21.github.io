Hello! My name is Eric. I am an application developer at Arup, and at work I create digital engineering solutions. These are several projects/goals I want to complete this year, and this blog will document my journey through it. 

<span style="color:blue">1. Data Science</span>

All the hype about it, right? At office, we are doing some image recognition projects and probably also some machine learning. I'll also try to join a few Kaggle competitions. There's a range of technology I'd like to work with, like Spark, TensorFlow, Caffe. Skills I'd like to gain include: 

- solve machine learning problems
- solve image recognition problems
- set up data pipeline
- do intelligent web-scrapping 

<span style="color:blue">2. Run Batch processes in the cloud</span>

This gives me a good chance to get in deep with Docker and AWS. Hopefully by the end I'll become a master of them!

<span style="color:blue">3. Earthworm</span>

Earthworm is a geotechnical suite we are developing on grasshopper using Python. The challenge is more of designing a streamlined workflow and a nice and flexible UX. But that's good, because I can practice my python! Also, along the way we might be able to add in some data science modules and cloud storage. 

### More Information

Eric is a certified C# developer, full-stack web developer and data scientist in training.
