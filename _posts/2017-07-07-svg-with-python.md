title: SVG with Python

Using Python (xlrd, pandas, svglib), I am able to convert a excel spreadsheet full of data into a pdf/png image as above. 
Before this is done, engineers print out a blank diagram and then manually search for the data in excel and write them one by one onto the diagram. That's because while you can probably code some VBA up for data extraction, there is no easily accesible way to code for placing text onto an image. Well, svg and python comes to the rescue! Python is extremely cool and simplifies a lot of coding.
