title: Geometry in Grasshopper
---

Recently I spent most of my time in Excel macro for India. There are a lot of changes and the design has become quite complicated to the point that it is hard to verify the code. 

Also, I spent a little bit of time to create a simple pile visualisation module in grasshopper. It's my first time interacting with the graphics component in Rhino.
