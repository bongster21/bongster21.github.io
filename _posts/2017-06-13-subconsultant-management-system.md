Today I had a chance to revisit an old project, a subconsultant management system built with Angular and ASP .NET MVC. I'm surprised it's still running!

Some screenshots:

Create a project. Define who's the PM, Adminsitrator and Participants.

There's a flow of approval system. Approved documents will be stored for easy tracking. A email is sent out to notify the next party whenever an action is completed.

Payments and invoices are easily tracked. Approved dates are clearly marked. Imagine you have hundreds of invoices and you have to look at all the correspondences to find out the invoice statuses! That would be a PM nightmare.

A to-do list to remind you of what needs to be done.
