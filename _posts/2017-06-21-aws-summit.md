Today I went to the AWS summit first ever held in Hong Kong. It was very exciting. Amazon showcased many very interesting technologies and many fascinating start up ideas. The keynote speeches were interesting. It was full of demos and use cases in healthcare (DNA sequencing), energy (electricity sharing/get paid to use less), traffic (bangkok real time traffic with IoT), car maintenance, facebook chatbots, and a lot of Alexas. 

In the afternoon, there were sessions demonstrating the workflow of big data. There were a bunch of technologies for each of the steps in Collect/Store/Process/Consume. One session used Kinesis, EMR, S3, Hive, Spark and Redshift. Another used Kinese Firehose, EMR, S3, Hive, Spark and Jupyter. It was very cool. Also there's another session on Docker and Amazon's container service, which I have tried to use before.

This is where the industries are heading, and it is of necessity to understand these technologies.
