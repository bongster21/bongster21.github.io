Story: This dashboard is built to monitor the pile progress of XJH Center, a high-rise in Shanghai. The data input from engineers are collected in their regular Excel forms and synced to the database through a python script. From the dashboard, the engineer can easily see where there are any anomalies in the data collected and whether there is any delay. Through filtering by pile type, machinery or engineersâ€™ notes, they can further drill down into the data and identify the cause.
