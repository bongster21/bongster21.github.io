Today I tidied up my front-end development portfolio. 


Shanghai Pile Dashboard

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhyV4KIy0JA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, D3, Plotly, Leaflet, Postgres, Loopback, Gulp, Node, Heroku
This dashboard is built to monitor the pile progress of XJH Center, a high-rise in Shanghai. The data input from engineers are collected in their regular Excel forms and synced to the database through a python script. From the dashboard, the engineer can easily see where there are any anomalies in the data collected and whether there is any delay. Through filtering by pile type, machinery or engineers’ notes, they can further drill down into the data and identify the cause.



Shopping Mall Dashboard

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGDG8wZwt_c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, D3, Plotly, Leaflet, Postgres, Loopback, Gulp, Node, Heroku
This prototype dashboard is developed for New World Development Company to demonstrate the usefulness of shopping mall analytics. The project is done on a set of sample data provided to us on K11, one of their shopping malls. The sample data includes MAC addresses of mobile phones connected to the WIFI, social media data and CRM data. From these we are able to determine the hot and cold zones, dwell times, customer paths, stay spots analysis, time of day profile and shop profile analysis. 



TFL Transport Dashboard

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSUNOGrlcho" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, D3, Plotly, Leaflet, Postgres, PostGIS, QGIS, Loopback, Gulp, Node, Heroku
This prototype dashboard is developed for Transport for London to demonstrate the usefulness of a transport data management strategy. The Battersea area in London will be redeveloped and traffic congestion is expected to become more severe with the increase in large construction vehicles. In this dashboard, we overlay the expected delivery schedules over the existing transport data to show where and when potential congestion will be. TFL can further look into the problem through exploring different filters and the Gantt chart.


Mega block Data Parsing Tool

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wU9dDDC_w9c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, D3, Postgres, Loopback, Gulp, Node, Heroku
This is a proposed interface for a well-known software company to upload and organize its Workplace Guidelines. The major problem in designing this interface is that the same guideline might apply to various space types, regions and profiles and we don’t want the use to fill in the same details repetitively. Therefore, we propose an interface where the user can select multiple areas where the same rule applies.


KTBA Public Engagement

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhcvfoAC-Ig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: ArcGIS API for javascript, dojo, html CSS, SQL
We were commissioned to formulate a comprehensive plan for transformation of KTBA into the second CBD of Hong Kong and enhance connectivity, walkability, road traffic circulation and road safety in KTBA. We knew people would have something to say about this important development, so we helped them get involved in the design process by using creating a map-based community engagement tool. This allows locals to easily contribute their ideas and feeback without having to go to workshops. Harnessing this communication, our planning team was able to make thoughtful, relevant design decisions and then refine them using people's feedback.


East Asia GIS Database

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6g5nqYgQ1_U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Flex, Actionscript, Javascript, HTML, CSS, ArcGIS Server
We set up a ArcGIS server to host geospatial data for different groups, including Geotechnics, environmental, maritime and traffic. Access rights are set up for each group. The portal comes with some geospatial functions as well, such as show elevation profile, compare different satellite images and search/download boreholes.



Subcontractor Management System

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWpcpfpH7wA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, CSS, HTML, ASP MVC, ASP .NET, C#, SQL, Entity
This is a system to allow project managers to efficiently track subcontractor payments. In the current practice, the forms need to go through multiple parties both internally and externally. It becomes difficult for a PM to know what the status is without asking a lot of people and going through a long list of correspondents. The problem becomes even worse when the PM is taking care of several projects, each with many subcontractors! This system solves this problem by providing a central location for PMs and administrators to keep track of the documents throughout the whole approval and payment process. 


THREE js Visualisation

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4glS-tb8IM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, Threejs, designlink
This is the visualization part of a structural optimization project. We have previously created a C# application that runs optimization on a structure. The result can be ported into this web application for easy visualization. The flexible coloring scheme allows the user to easily color-code the values of the updated schema. 


Cavern Energy Calculation Tool

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9J3vod6PZqc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Angular, D3, ASP MVC, Excel
In Hong Kong, we performed a feasibility study for the government about making use of caverns to increase usable space. This web application can calculate the energy savings of moving a facility into caverns. The calculations are performed in a Excel spreadsheet designed by our MEP colleagues. The application runs the Excel spreadsheet in the background and outputs graphs that show the energy savings. It allows the users to design different cavern scenarios. We also created a simply html website for this study: http://www.cavern.gov.hk/ 



Office Seating Plan

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5PGRxFnGcE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: ArcGIS API for javascript, dojo, jquery, SQL
Story: This is a web interface for Arup Hong Kong colleagues to quickly locate other colleagues, meeting rooms, printers, escape routes and toilets.


3D Seating Plan

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9h_OeuUacs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: Unity3D, C#, 3DMax, ArcMap, ArcScene, LDAP, ASP .NET
We bring the GIS and CAD files of our 2D seating plan into the Unity3D game engine to create a 3D seating plan, where user can walk around the office in first-person mode. This demo generated a lot of excitement in the office, and showcased the possibilities of creative use of geospatial data. 


Artists Fund

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0lhthpLv5o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology: ASP MVC, C#, JQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Google Map API, Mastercard API, Redis
Story: This is a submission to the Mastercard Master of Code hackathon. We designed an application that allows street artists to connect with their audience, and an easy electronic way for audience to tip their favorite artists. It can show what street performances are near you on a map, and also allows you to follow an artist and browse his profile. This submission came third in the competition.


Palm Oil Optimization Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9iMz0KS4-U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Technology:  Angular, D3, Gulp, Node, Heroku
This is a submission to the London Zoo Hackathon 2016. Palm oil production is a major threat to the rainforests in Malaysia and Indonesia, and endangers the habitats of orangutans. A major deterrent to palm oil farmers in producing sustainable palm oil is the complicated process of obtaining certification. Our idea is to create a web app to provide useful information to encourage farmers to apply for certification and to guide them through the process. This submission came third in the competition.
