title: Setting up the blog using Jekyll and Github
---

It's not as easy as I expect to set up a blog on Github. This is because there is the in-built Github Pages that only requires a _conf.yaml_ and you can choose a theme for it, and then there is the theme repositories that contains the whole file stack and you can fork it to your repository. 

I used the second method because I want to be able to add and edit the content files. 

The way I do it:

1. Form a repository of your selected Jekyll theme
2. In the Settings of your forked repository, change the name to USERNAME.github.io (Note: It's not USERNAME.github.com anymore)
3. That's it. In the settings it will say that your site is hosted at USERNAME.github.io.
